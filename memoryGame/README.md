#### How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Game Functionality
The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in my project. There are a couple of interactions that we  need to handle:

- Flipping cards
- What happens when cards match
- What happens when cards do not match
- When the game finishes
